        <h2>Duties and responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Give cadets basics and certify troopers when prompted. (Read how to properly certify people down below)
            </li>
            <li>Preferably host trainings.</li>
            <li>During trainings if there are a lot of people you are to help “keep the peace” and enforce red comms
                when need be.</li>
            <li>A “senior NCO” is defined as 1SGT, but evaluation is required before being allowed senior NCO tasks,
                including; changing roles and names of other people. If you play around with these permissions (such as
                changing somebody’s name as a joke), then you are likely going to see your permissions removed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Certification guide:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Give cert to enlisted.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Chart Chart that you gave a cert to the trooper in nco certifications.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Tell them to request the role in the request channel. (They will not get their role unless it’s
                been charted in the certification channel)</li>
            <li><b>Recruit one person monthly, failure will result in a demotion and points set to zero. (Terms and
                    conditions apply. Read the pinned message in NCO chat.)</b></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rules with recruiting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The age limit to join is 13+, but if they show maturity then an exception can be made. (State if their
                age is an exception in the reports channel, multiple NCOs+ will have to verify if they are mature during
                their first couple trainings) That being said, do not allow an immature person to join just because they
                are over the age limit.</li>
            <li>If you are giving basics and one of them is being quite obnoxious or disruptive then drop that cadet, do
                not continue taking them into the server.</li>
            <li>Ask if they have Discord, heavily preferred; also ask if they have been in any other PvP groups, if so,
                ask the name of those groups and their server size.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to give basics</h2>
        <p><b>This should take around twenty or so minutes!!</b></p>
        <h3>Take them to Cali's Citadel</h3>
        <p><b>FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE EVERYTHING!</b> Discipline the new troopers, but be more friendly and gentle with
            the new troops. “Teach them, do not discipline them; there is a difference.” - Zen I think</p>
        <h3>Things to go over in basics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Coms (Red, yellow, green)</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Formations. (Alpha is columns of 5, bravo is shoulder to shoulder, or STS for short).</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Demonstrate faces and have them follow you. Be sure to explain that you will always turn over your
                    right
                    shoulder unless “left face” is called.</h3>
                (Front, right, left, about, center face. [Turn over your right shoulder and look at the training host or
                whoever called it])
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Explain that in 2.0 worlds you want to “choke up on the gun” so you don’t shoot your hand.
                    (Demonstrate
                    with a carbine)</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What 2.0 and 3.0 combat is:</h3>
                <p>With 3.0 combat you shoot directly at your target, and with 2.0 combat you shoot ahead of your
                    target. In 2.0 combat if the person being shot at sees the bullet hit them, then they would be hurt;
                    whereas in 3.0 combat it doesn’t matter if they don’t see you hit them, if you see your shot hit or
                    hear it hit then they will take damage.</p>
                <p>Ask if they need further explanation, if so then do this:
                    Have them run behind a barricade and you shoot them as they are running behind it to further explain
                    what 3.0 reverse latency is. After that ask if they understand, then explain we mainly use 3.0
                    worlds because most 2.0 worlds are broken with the latest VRC update.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Go over what credits are:</h3>
                <p>Credits, otherwise called points, are used to rank up. You get 200 points per training attended and
                    100 per recruit- but they must join the discord server for you to get points. As an enlisted (which
                    you are), you need 600 points for your next rank. If let's say you have 800 points for whatever
                    reason (like if we just haven’t promoted you yet), then those extra points will be credited towards
                    your next rank. Remember, as you rank up– say if you have 700 points and the requirement is 600, you
                    have to subtract points used to rank up, so you’ll go down to 100 total points after the rank is
                    granted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Tell the cadet once they get 600 points they can be promoted to trooper and can go down marksman,
                    heavy, or assault– assault has grenades:</h3>
                <p>Once you have 600 points as previously mentioned you’ll become a trooper when promoted. As a trooper
                    you can go down the heavy, marksman, or assault path– assaults have grenades.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Teammate flagging:</h3>
                <p>Real simple but not everyone does it, try not to flag your teammates. What this means is don’t point
                    your gun at teammates.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Name tags must be off during combat:</h3>
                <p>This is an important rule, please make sure your name tags are turned off during combat. If you don’t
                    know how to turn them off I can tell you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Mention you can only dual-wield either two pistols, or one pistol and the bacta gun. Tell them they
                    can use any weapon they want, and can pursue any weapon that interests them. Also tell them there
                    are flamethrowers in some maps just not in this one:</h3>
                <p>You can use any weapons on the wall during your cadet training to try them out, but during normal
                    trainings you only get to use the carbine or pistol since you are not certified in any weapons yet.
                    We also have flamethrowers in some maps, just not this one. If you want to use the med gun, you can
                    use a carbine or pistol with it. You can also dual wield pistols, and if you want to use a shield
                    you can use a carbine with it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Take them for a 3 life game with the capture objective enabled and explain how capturing works and
                    how to get up to it. If there is only 1 cadet 1v1 them; if there are 2 cadets, fight against them
                    and explain thoroughly how to defend the flag (you attack they defend). If any other number just
                    evenly split the cadets and join the team with less members if your judgment deems it needed.
                    (Gradually ramp up the difficulty, but if they pose a good fight let them win)</h3>
                <p>We will be doing a 3 life game of capture the flag. Follow me to droid side please; the droid side is
                    almost always the red portal, the clone side is always the blue one. As a clone you will spawn all
                    the way down there and will work your way towards the flag up there. To get over here from the clone
                    side you can take the tunnels (grab pistol and shoot at the clone tunnel entrance) the entrance is
                    right there, and the exit is right there; or you can come head on by using the barricades as cover.
                    You are also allowed to enter the towers with the portal right outside it as either a clone or droid
                    if you wish. After this battle I’ll ask you which weapon you want to go for.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>After the PvP, ask them what weapon they want to pursue and tell them what MOS’s have that weapon.
                </h3>
                <p>Now that you’ve had a chance to try out most of the weapons, do you know which one you’d like to
                    pursue?</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Also explain:</h3>
                <p>In the discord server, the MOS channels– which are called; basic, advanced, specialized, and elite
                    all list what weapons they are allowed to use. So if you are curious about what weapons other MOS’s
                    use, then feel free to explore the channels; they are at the bottom of the server channel list.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Tell them any NCO can train them in an MOS – unless it is in the specialized or elite discord
                    channels, then they’ll have to contact whoever’s name is listed.</h3>
                <p>To request training in an MOS go to the requests channel and request it. The only exception is if you
                    want to join an elite or specialized MOS, then you will have to talk to whoever’s name is listed
                    below that MOS. Any NCO should know the answer to just about any question you might have, so feel
                    free to ask! Also don’t be scared of the COs, they are nice. You can ask them if confused as well,
                    just come to NCOs first if possible. Though at trainings, don’t hesitate to ask any NCO or CO a
                    question if they are there, we are all here to help! The COs are Zen- being the big boy owner, and
                    Austin- the one that likes men sometimes. You’ll learn who they are over time, don’t worry.</p>

        <h2>How to give trooper rank training</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>“Are there any new cadets being promoted to trooper today? I would like to steal you for a moment.
                    Remember you can be promoted to trooper when you get 600 points, or attend 3 trainings.”</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Ask if they have any questions about anything regarding the server or their cadet training.</h3>
                <p>Before I give you a quick rundown on what lies ahead in your next rank, did you have any questions
                    about the server or your cadet training?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Tell them what MOS’s they can join as a trooper, and what opportunities they have available when
                    becoming a private or PFC.</h3>
                <p>You’re probably wondering “How do I join an MOS?,” right? Well ask any NCO or higher after a training
                    if they can certify you in X Y or Z, orrrr you can use the requests channel and request training
                    with that MOS. After you get training in marksman, heavy, or assault as a trooper then you can go in
                    the request channel and request the MOS. Keep in mind when you become private you can become the
                    advanced version of that MOS and gain access to more weapons. Also when you become one rank higher
                    at PFC you can join a specialized MOS, but keep in mind those are MOS restricted, meaning they
                    require you to be, for example, either assault or heavy. You can read about their requirements in
                    the specialized channel under the MOS information category, nearly each one has different
                    requirements. As usual you can ask any NCO or higher if you have any questions. Did you have any on
                    mind for me right now?</p>
