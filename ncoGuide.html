        <h2>Duties and responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Give cadets basics and certify troopers when prompted. (Read how to properly certify people down below)
            </li>
            <li>Preferably host trainings.</li>
            <li>During trainings if there are a lot of people you are to help “keep the peace” and enforce red comms
                when need be.</li>
            <li>A “senior NCO” is defined as 1SGT, but evaluation is required before being allowed senior NCO tasks,
                including; changing roles and names of other people. If you play around with these permissions (such as
                changing somebody’s name as a joke), then you are likely going to see your permissions removed.</li>
            <li>Make sure troopers remain in armour while in training, in pre-lobby and main lobby instances.</li>
            <li>As NCO, you can discipline as you see fit, within reason. When a trooper or fellow NCO (let's hope not)
                misbehaves by breaking rules or cheating, you are allowed
                to, and should, deal with it. Ways to do so can be to take them to the side and talk, warn them, hold
                off
                their points for a period of time, lock them at their current rank or take away points
                entirely. Demoting is a CO duty, so if you believe that is in order you can request the COs to do so.
                These punishments can scale in severity/frequency/duration according to the severity/frequency
                of their behavior. If their behavior is really out of line and disrupting training, you have the right
                to kick them from training. Whenever you take any of these action, you are to write a report of what
                happened and what you did in #reports.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Certification guide:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Give cert to enlisted.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Chart that you gave a cert to the trooper in nco certifications.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Tell them to request the role in the request channel. (They will not get their role unless it’s
                been charted in the certification channel)</li>
            <li><b>Recruit one person monthly, failure will result in a demotion and points set to zero. (Terms and
                    conditions apply. Read the pinned message in NCO chat.)</b></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rules with recruiting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The age limit to join is 13+, but if they show maturity then an exception can be made. (State if their
                age is an exception in the reports channel, multiple NCOs+ will have to verify if they are mature during
                their first couple trainings) That being said, do not allow an immature person to join just because they
                are over the age limit.</li>
            <li>If you are giving basics and one of them is being quite obnoxious or disruptive then drop that cadet, do
                not continue taking them into the server.</li>
            <li>Ask if they have Discord, heavily preferred; also ask if they have been in any other PvP groups, if so,
                ask the name of those groups and their server size.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="basics">
        <h2>How to give basics</h2>
        <p><b>This should take around twenty or so minutes!!</b></p>
        <h3>Take them to Mygeeto or a citadel (for example)</h3>
        <p><b>FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE EVERYTHING!</b> Discipline the new troopers, but be more friendly and gentle with
            the new troops. “Teach them, do not discipline them; there is a difference.” - Zen I think</p>
        <p>As a new NCO, the first two basics you give will be supervised by a senion NCO or CO.</p>
        <h3>Things to go over in basics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Coms (Red, yellow, green)</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Formations. (Alpha is columns of 5, bravo is shoulder to shoulder, or STS for short).</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Demonstrate faces and have them follow you. Be sure to explain that you will always turn over your
                    right
                    shoulder unless “left face” is called.</h3>
                <p>(Front, right, left, about, center face. [Turn over your right shoulder and look at the training host
                    or
                    whoever called it])</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Explain that in 2.0 worlds you want to “choke up on the gun” so you don’t shoot your hand.
                    (Demonstrate
                    with a carbine)</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What 2.0 and 3.0 combat is:</h3>
                <p>With 3.0 combat you shoot directly at your target, and with 2.0 combat you shoot ahead of your
                    target, lead your shot. There is also 3.5 combat, you still shoot them directly but there are small
                    differences like being able to see anyone's health bar if they are damaged. Don't worry about
                    memorizing all the different combat systems right now, you will learn them over time.</p>
                <p>Ask if they need further explanation, if so then physically run them through the answers. (Like take
                    them to the combat system in question and show them)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Go over what credits are:</h3>
                <p>Credits, otherwise called points, are used to rank up. You get 200 points per training attended and
                    100 per recruit, though if they are not in the Discord server then you must provide their VRC name.
                    As an enlisted (which
                    you are), you need 600 points for your next rank. If let's say you have 800 points for whatever
                    reason (like if we just haven’t promoted you yet), then those extra points will be credited towards
                    your next rank. Remember, as you rank up– say if you have 700 points and the requirement is 600, you
                    have to subtract points used to rank up, so you’ll go down to 100 total points after the rank is
                    granted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Tell the cadet once they get 600 points they can be promoted to trooper and can go down any MOS
                    unless it has a higher rank required:</h3>
                <p>Once you have 600 points as previously mentioned you’ll become a trooper when promoted. As a trooper
                    you can go down almost any of the MOS paths in the channels in the bottom of the Discord server. You
                    can also grab an auxillary such as medic, pilot, airborne, etc. on the side, as well as an MOS; just
                    make sure to check if the rank required is trooper or higher.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Teammate flagging:</h3>
                <p>Real simple but not everyone does it, try not to flag your teammates. What this means is don’t point
                    your gun at teammates.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Name tags must be off during combat:</h3>
                <p>This is an important rule, please make sure your name tags are turned off during combat. Do you know
                    how to turn it off?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Peaking:</h3>
                <p>When peaking around a corner, you must uncover at least 50% of your body when you're shooting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Make sure they read the server rules, as these include combat rules.</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Mention you can only dual-wield either two pistols, or one pistol and the bacta gun. Tell them they
                    can use any weapon they want, and can pursue any weapon that interests them. Also tell them there
                    are flamethrowers in some maps just not in this one:</h3>
                <p>You can dual-wield or use any weapon you wish during this cadet tryout, but during a normal training
                    you are limited to the carbine or pistol until you join an MOS or get an auxillary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Run the cadet(s) through a ten minute capture the flag match and remind them they can use any
                    weapons and are not limited to one weapon the whole game.</h3>
                <p>We will be doing a ten minute training, your objective is to get the flag on top of the citadel. No
                    life limit, just grab whatever guns you want each time you respawn so you can try them all out.
                    Remember, ten minutes to capture the flag.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>After the PvP, ask them what weapon they want to pursue and tell them what MOS’s have that weapon.
                </h3>
                <p>Now that you’ve had a chance to try out most of the weapons, do you know which one you’d like to
                    pursue? I can direct you toward an MOS with it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Also explain:</h3>
                <p>In our server we have compiled all our MOS's into 3 channels; assault, heavy, and marksman- feel free
                    to explore them as you wish.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Tell them any NCO can train them in an MOS – unless a name is listed with said MOS, then you must
                    message that person directly.</h3>
                <p>Any NCO can train you in an MOS – unless a name is listed with said MOS, then you must message that
                    person directly. If you have any questions feel free to ask any NCO, CO, or the Secretary; you can
                    find them online in Discord or at trainings. If you aren't comfortable with that or didn't catch
                    anyone, we also have a questions channel.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When you've gone over everything, have them pick a callsign and CT number.</h3>
        <p>This consists of a 4 digit number and a nickname (which preferably needs to be in or similar to their vrc
            name), make sure to have them put it in the requests channel. Once they are an NCO, they are free to have
            their callsign changed (once a month). Also mention that their status must be on orange during trainings. If
            they don't know how to change it, help them.</p>

                    This means first you heal an ally, then you must wait 5 seconds because you plan to heal yourself,
                    then wait 3 seconds before healing an ally again.</p>
                <h3>3.5:</h3>
                <p>No cooldown.</p>
